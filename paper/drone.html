    <p><em>Abstract</em>—This document presents a comprehensive study on the two-dimensional and three-dimensional
      simulations of drone dynamics. It outlines the methodology for simulating the state and dynamics of drones in
      two-dimensional and three-dimensional environments, and discusses the determination of simulation parameters,
      including the experimental methods used. Theoretical models are established, and the results from the experiments
      are provided to better understand and predict the performance and behavior of drones under different operational
      conditions.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <section>
    <p>This document details the simulation of drone dynamics both in a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional space.
      The importance of accurate simulation lies in the potential for optimization of drone flight parameters for
      efficiency, agility, and stability. The paper outlines a framework for generating realistic dynamic behaviors and
      predicting the impact of design changes and environmental influences on flight performance.</p>
  </section>

  <h1>Two-Dimensional Simulation</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>State</h2>
    <p>A simulation is considered complete when it can predict the state $X$ of the drone for the next discrete time
      segment.</p>
    <div class="equation">\( X = [x , y, \phi, \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}] \)</div>
    <p>The state \( X \) consists of the coordinates on the y-axis, which points negatively towards the center of the
      Earth, the x-axis, and the angle vector \( \phi \), which represents rotational position around the x-axis.
      Additionally, the velocities \( \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi} \) are part of the state vector. The thrust forces \(
      F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) from the two rotors, combined with environmental forces, lead to changes in the drone's
      state.</p>
    <div class="figure">

      <p class="caption">Figure 1: Two-dimensional drone representation.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The thrust forces \( F_{1} \) and \( F_{2} \) are oriented at the angle \( \phi \) relative to the y-axis.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Dynamics</h2>
    <p>Dynamics describe how the state \( X \) changes over time based on the thrust forces \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \). The
      forces are expressed via the rotor velocities \( \omega_1 \) and \( \omega_2 \). The relationship between the
      rotor velocity and the generated force is quadratic:</p>
    <div class="equation">\( F_{i} = k_{f} \omega_{i}^2 \)</div>
    <p>This quadratic relationship \( k_{f} \) is empirically determined as detailed in the section on Simulation
      Parameter Determination. The resultant force and torque dynamics subsequently determine the changes in the state
      \( X \).</p>

      <p class="caption">Figure 2: Forces acting on a two-dimensional drone.</p>
    </div>
    <p>By resolving these forces into components parallel to the x and y axes and employing Newton's second law \( F =
      ma \), it is possible to derive the accelerations across these axes.</p>
  </section>
  <!--
  <h1>Three-Dimensional Simulation</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>State</h2>
    <p>In the three-dimensional case, the state vector \( X \) extends to accommodate three-dimensional space and
      orientation. It comprises of twelve distinct elements:</p>
    <div class="equation">\( X = [x, y, z, \phi, \theta, \psi, \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z}, p, q, r] \)</div>
    <p>Here, \( x, y, z \) represent the drone's positional coordinates, \( \phi, \theta, \psi \) represent its
      orientation in terms of Euler angles, and \( \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z}, p, q, r \) represent the velocities and
      rotational rates, respectively. These values are referenced to either a world coordinate system or a body-fixed
      coordinate system.</p>
    <div class="figure">
      <img class="fig" src="3d_drone_coordinate_system.png" alt="World and body coordinate systems">
      <p class="caption">Figure 3: Illustration of world and body coordinate systems in 3D drone modeling.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Dynamics</h2>
    <p>The dynamics in the three-dimensional simulation extend those in the two-dimensional case to include additional
      forces and moments due to the increased complexity of movement in 3D space. The established relationship between
      thrust and rotor velocity remains valid. By integrating these forces over time, one can predict the future state
      of the drone, accounting for the inertial properties and rotational dynamics.</p>

        and numbering.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <h1>Determination of Simulation Parameters</h1>
  <section>
    <p>Simulation accuracy greatly depends on the precise determination of several intrinsic and extrinsic parameters
      that describe the drone's physical properties and its interaction with the environment. These include the mass \(
      m \), thrust-to-velocity relationship constants \( k_f \) and \( k_m \), and the moments of inertia \( I_x, I_y,
      I_z \). These parameters are derived from controlled experiments.</p>

    <p>The results of these experiments yield values for \( k_f \) and \( k_m \), as well as moments of inertia that are
      crucial for simulating the drone dynamics with high fidelity.</p>
