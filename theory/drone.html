    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        The objective of this work is to formalize the principles of co-axial
        dual and quad rotor aerodynamics, a specialized area within fluid
        dynamics. Co-axial rotors refer to systems where multiple rotors are
        aligned along the same rotational axis, commonly facing in the same
        direction. This formalization provides a foundational basis for
        practical applications in aeronautics, specifically in the design and
        operation of airborne vehicles. In this context, "drone" refers to both
        dual and quad rotor systems, where dual rotor implies a system with two
        rotating propellers and quad rotor denotes a system with four.

      <h2>State Representation</h2>
      <p>
        A simulation is considered comprehensive if it can predict the drone's
        state \(X\) for subsequent discrete time intervals.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \( X = [x, y, \phi, \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}] \)
      </div>
      <p>
        Here, \(X\) encapsulates the drone's coordinates (\(x, y\)), rotational
        angle (\(\phi\)) about the x-axis, and their corresponding velocities
        (\(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}\)). The thrust forces (\(F_{1}\) and
        \(F_{2}\)) from the rotors, combined with environmental factors, result
        in the alteration of the state vector \(X\). The thrusts \(F_{1}\) and
        \(F_{2}\) are angled relative to the y-axis by \(\phi\).

      <h2>Dynamics Formulation</h2>
      <p>
        The dynamics of the drone are characterized by how its state \(X\)
        evolves under the influence of forces \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\). These
        forces, as a function of rotor velocities (\(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}\)),
        follow a relationship with thrust, denoted by \(k_{f}\), that is derived
        from the principles of fluid dynamics and aerodynamics. These
        disciplines, building upon Newton's Laws of
        <span style="white-space: nowrap"
          >Motion <a href="#newton1687">1</a></span
        >, specifically address the interaction between the rotors and the
        surrounding air. The force generated by the rotors is proportional to
        the square of their velocity.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">\( F_{i} = k_{f} \omega_{i}^2 \)</div>
      <p>
        The thrust components \(F_{x}\) and \(F_{y}\), acting along the x-axis
        and y-axis respectively, are determined by trigonometric relationships,
        based on principles established in Euclid's work
        <a href="#euclid300bc">4</a>, derived from the total thrust force
        <span style="white-space: nowrap">(\(F_{total} = F_1 + F_2\))</span> and
        the orientation angle (\(\phi\)).
      </p>

        \[ F_{y} = \cos(\phi)F_{total} \qquad F_{x} = \sin(\phi)F_{total} \]

        Changes in the drone's position (\(x, y, \phi\)) are derived from the
        integration of velocities (\(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}\)), which in
        turn stem from the integration of accelerations (\(\ddot{x}, \ddot{y},
        \ddot{\phi}\)). These accelerations are calculated using Newton's second
        law <span style="white-space: nowrap">(\(F = ma\))</span>
        <a href="#newton1687">1</a> and the gravitational force (\(F_{g} =
        mg\)), with \(g\) being earth's gravitational constant \( 9.81
        \frac{m}{s^2} \).
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ \ddot{y} = \frac{(F_{y} - F_{g})}{m} = \frac{F_{y}}{m} - g \qquad
        \ddot{x} = \frac{F_{x}}{m} \]
      </div>
      <p>
        We employ two torque formulas (\(M_{x}\)), each with distinct historical
        and physical foundations. The first, \(M_{x} = F_{\phi} L\), originates
        from Archimedes' concept of leverage
        <a href="#archimedes250bc">3</a>, where \(F_{\phi} = F_{2} - F_{1}\)
        represents the force from the drone's rotors and \(L\) is the lever arm
        - the distance from the center of mass to the motors. This equation
        captures the rotational effect of force. The second, \(M_{x} = I_{x}
        \ddot{\phi}\), is grounded in Newton's laws of motion
        <a href="#newton1687">1</a>, linking torque (\(M_{x}\)) with the drone's
        moment of inertia (\(I_{x}\)) and angular acceleration
        (\(\ddot{\phi}\)). Together, these formulas allow us to determine the
        angular acceleration of the drone.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ M_{x} = F_{\phi}L \\ I_{x} \ddot{\phi} = (F_{2} - F_{1})L \\
        \ddot{\phi} = \frac{(F_{2} - F_{1}) L}{I_{x}} \]
      </div>

      <p>
        The state of the drone at time \( t + \Delta t \) is determined by the
        sum of its current state \( X_t \) and the integral of the state's time
        derivative \( \dot{X} \) over the interval \( \Delta t \). This integral
        represents a precise calculation of the state change. However, for
        computational simplicity, we often use an approximation method developed
        by Leonhard Euler <a href="#euler1768">2</a>. His method approximates
        the future state by assuming a constant rate of change (\( \dot{X}_t \))
        over a small interval
        <span style="white-space: nowrap">(\( \Delta t \approx 0.01\))</span>,
        simplifying the integral to a product of the rate of change and the time
        interval.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ X_{t + \Delta t} = X_{t} + \int_{t}^{t+\Delta t} \dot{X}_{\tau} d\tau
        \approx X_t + \Delta t\dot{X}_t \]
      </div>

      <p>
        To thoroughly describe the time evolution of the drone's state, we
        substitude the explicit expressions for the accelerations \(\ddot{x}\),
        \(\ddot{y}\), and \(\ddot{\phi}\) into the equation for \( X_{t + \Delta
        t} \). These accelerations are directly derived from the drone's
        dynamics, which include the influence of forces and torques resulting
        from the rotor thrusts and earth's gravity.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \( X_{t + \Delta t} \approx X_t + \Delta t \dot{X}_t= \begin{bmatrix} x

      <h2>State Representation</h2>
      <p>
        The three-dimensional state vector, \(X\), extends the two-dimensional
        model by integrating additional spatial and rotational parameters. It is
        crucial for representing the drone's comprehensive state in
        three-dimensional space.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \( X = [x, y, z, \phi, \theta, \psi, \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z}, p, q, r]
        \)
      </div>
      <p>The elements of state vector \(X\) include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>\(x, y, z\): The drone's positional coordinates in 3D space,</li>
        <li>
          \(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z}\): Linear velocities along the x, y, and z
          axes,
        </li>
        <li>
          \(\phi, \theta, \psi\): Euler rotational angles around the x, y, and z
          axes, respectively,
        </li>
        <li>
          \(p, q, r\): Angular velocities related to the above axes, within the
          drone's frame of reference.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is imperative to differentiate between the "world coordinate system",
        an external fixed reference frame, and the "body coordinate system",
        which is intrinsic to the drone and changes with its movements and
        orientation.

      <h2>Dynamics Formulation</h2>
      <p>
        Equation (2) still applies here as before. Analogous to Equation 10, in
        the three-dimensional case, we also require the derivative \(\dot{X}\)
        of the state vector to move the state forward in time. Equations (3)
        still apply but now, analogous to \(\ddot{y}\), we add the formula for
        \(\ddot{x}\). In summary, still derived from Newton's \(F = ma\), we
        have
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ \ddot{z} = \frac{F_{g} - F_{z}}{m} = g - F_{z} \qquad \ddot{y} =
        \frac{F_{y}}{m} \qquad \ddot{x} = \frac{F_{x}}{m} \]
      </div>
      <p>
        Different from the two-dimensional case, however, are the formulas for
        \(F_{x}\), \(F_{y}\), and \(F_{z}\). Here a rotation matrix is defined,
        which transforms any vector from the body coordinate system into a
        vector in the world coordinate system through multiplication.
        Essentially, the matrix is still based on triangle trigonometry. The
        matrix \(R_{Body}^{World}\) is
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \begin{align*} R_{Body}^{World} &= \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0
        \\ 0 & \cos(\phi) & -\sin(\phi) \\ 0 & \sin(\phi) & \cos(\phi) \\
        \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} \cos(\theta) & 0 &
        \sin(\theta) \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -\sin(\theta) & 0 & \cos(\theta) \\
        \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} \cos(\psi) & -\sin(\psi) &
        0 \\ \sin(\psi) & \cos(\psi) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{array} \right] \\
        &= \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} c(\psi)c(\theta) & c(\psi)s(\theta)s(\phi)
        - s(\psi)c(\phi) & s(\psi)s(\phi) + c(\psi)s(\theta)c(\phi) \\
        s(\psi)c(\theta) & c(\psi)c(\phi) + s(\psi)s(\theta)s(\phi) &
        s(\psi)s(\theta)c(\phi) - c(\psi)s(\phi) \\ -s(\theta) &
        c(\theta)s(\phi) & c(\theta)c(\phi) \end{array} \right] \end{align*}
      </div>
      <p>
        So, from Equations (22) and (23), we derive the formulas for axis
        accelerations in the world coordinate system as
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ \begin{bmatrix} \ddot{x} \\ \ddot{y} \\ \ddot{z} \end{bmatrix} =
        \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ g \end{array} \right] + \frac{1}{m}\:
        R_{Body}^{World} \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ -F_{total}
        \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}
        R_{13}\frac{1}{m}(-F_{total}) \\ R_{23}\frac{1}{m}(-F_{total}) \\ g +

        Here it is also shown that the propellers generate thrust in the
        direction \(-kz\). On Earth, \(g = 9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}\). And the total
        force now results from the sum of all four rotors, so that

        The moments of inertia \(I_{x}\), \(I_{y}\), and \(I_{z}\) are
        determined by experiments, as explained in Chapter
        <a href="#chapter-SimulationParameterDetermination"
          >Simulation Parameter Determination</a

      <p>
        As remaining necessary quantities to establish \(\dot{X}\), which is the
        goal in dynamics, we have the velocities about the world coordinate
        system axes \(\dot{\phi}\), \(\dot{\theta}\), and \(\dot{\psi}\). These
        are obtained, like the linear accelerations in Equation \ref{eq:24} with
        the help of a rotation matrix specifically for Euler angle velocities.

      <div class="equation">
        \[ \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\phi} \\ \dot{\theta} \\ \dot{\psi}

        Thus, the state of the quadrotor at time \(t\) can be determined by the
