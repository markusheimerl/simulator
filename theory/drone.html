        <em>Abstract</em>—This document presents a comprehensive study on the
        two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations of drone dynamics. It
        outlines the methodology for simulating the state and dynamics of drones
        in two-dimensional and three-dimensional environments, and discusses the
        determination of simulation parameters, including the experimental
        methods used. Theoretical models are established, and the results from
        the experiments are provided to better understand and predict the
        performance and behavior of drones under different operational
        conditions.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        This document details the simulation of drone dynamics both in a
        two-dimensional and a three-dimensional space. The importance of
        accurate simulation lies in the potential for optimization of drone
        flight parameters for efficiency, agility, and stability. The paper
        outlines a framework for generating realistic dynamic behaviors and
        predicting the impact of design changes and environmental influences on
        flight performance.

    <h1>Two-Dimensional Simulation</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>State</h2>
      <p>
        A simulation is considered complete when it can predict the state \(X\)
        of the drone for the next discrete time segment.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \( X = [x , y, \phi, \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}] \)
      </div>
      <p>
        The state \(X\) consists of the coordinates on the y-axis, which points
        negatively towards the center of the Earth, the x-axis, and the vector
        \(\phi\), which describes the rotation angle about the x-axis.
        Additionally, the velocities, i.e., the rates of change, \(\dot{x},
        \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}\) of these quantities are also part of the vector.
        The thrust \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\) of the two rotors, in combination
        with environmental influences, produce all forces that result in changes
        to the state vector \(X\).

          />
        </div>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The thrusts \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\) are directed at an angle \(\phi\) to
        the y-axis.
      </p>

      <h2>Dynamics</h2>
      <p>
        Dynamics describe how the state \(X\) changes based on \(F_{1}\) and
        \(F_{2}\). To work with fundamental quantities, \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\)
        are expressed by their underlying rotor velocities \(\omega_{1}\) and
        \(\omega_{2}\). The relationship \(k_{f}\) between rotor velocity and
        force is quadratic as shown in <a href="#johansen2004">1</a>. Hence, we
        have:
      </p>
      <div class="equation">\( F_{i} = k_{f} \omega_{i}^2 \)</div>
      <p>
        This relationship \(k_{f}\) is determined empirically as explained in
        Chapter SimulationParameterDetermination. The changes in state in the
        positions \(x\), \(y\), and \(\phi\) result from the integration of the
        velocities \(\dot{z}, \dot{y}\), and \(\dot{\phi}\). The state changes
        of these result from the integration of the accelerations \(\ddot{x},
        \ddot{y}\), and \(\ddot{\phi}\). These are derived from \(F = ma\) and
        the force of gravity \(F_{g} = mg\) with \(g = 9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}\):
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \(-\ddot{y} = \frac{F_{g} - F_{y}}{m} = F_{y} - g \qquad \ddot{x} =
        \frac{F_{x}}{m}\)
      </div>
      <p>
        \(F_{x}\) is parallel to the x-axis, and \(F_{y}\) is parallel to the
        y-axis. Thus, there is a right angle between \(F_{z}\) and \(F_{y}\).
        Additionally, it holds true that
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \(F_{total} = \sum_{1}^{i} F_{i} = F_{1} + F_{2}\)
      </div>
      <p>
        The total force of both rotors \(F_{total}\) is oriented at an angle
        \(\phi\) to the y-axis.
      </p>

          />
        </div>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Thus, the forces \(F_{x}\) and \(F_{y}\) result from the triangle's
        trigonometry as
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \(F_{y} = F_{total}\cos{\phi} \qquad F_{x} = F_{total}\sin{\phi}\)
      </div>
      <p>
        and the accelerations along the z- and y-axes by combining Equations 5,
        6, and 7:
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \(\ddot{y} = \frac{(F_{1} + F_{2})\cos{\phi}}{m} - g \qquad \ddot{x} =
        \frac{(F_{1} + F_{2})\sin{\phi}}{m}\)
      </div>
      <p>
        \(\ddot{\phi}\) is derived through the combination of the equations for
        torque \(M\). \(l\) is the distance from the center of mass of the
        dual-rotor drone to one of the motors.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \(M_{x} = F_{\phi} l \qquad M_{x} = I_{x} \ddot{\phi}\)
      </div>
      <p>
        The moment of inertia \(I_{x}\) has to be determined experimentally, as
        described in Chapter SimulationParameterDetermination. The force around
        the z-axis \(F_{\phi}\) is the difference in the two motor forces
        \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) from Figure Two-dimensional drone. A positive
        \(F_{\phi}\) corresponds to counter-clockwise rotation, and a negative
        value indicates clockwise rotation. In summary, we have:
      </p>
      <div class="equation">\(F_{\phi} = F_{2} - F_{1}\)</div>
      <p>
        Therefore, the angular acceleration \(\ddot{\phi}\) can be described as
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \(\ddot{\phi} = \frac{(F_{2} - F_{1}) \cdot l}{I_{x}}\)
      </div>
      <p>
        Hence, the dual-rotor drone's state at time \(t\) can be determined by
        the sum of the state \(X(t)\) and the integral of the time derivative of
        the state \(\dot{X}\).
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \(X(t + \Delta t) = X(t) + \int_{t}^{t+\Delta t}\dot{X}(\tau) d\tau\)
      </div>
