        <em>Abstract</em>—In this study, a comprehensive analysis of drone
        dynamics through two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)
        simulations is presented. The paper elaborates on simulation
        methodologies in 2D and 3D spaces, discussing the determination of key
        simulation parameters and experimental methodologies. Theoretical models
        are formulated, and empirical data are analyzed to enhance the
        understanding and prediction of drone behavior under various operational
        scenarios.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        This paper explores the simulation of drone dynamics in both 2D and 3D
        perspectives, emphasizing the importance of precise simulation for
        optimizing drone flight parameters including efficiency, agility, and
        stability. It proposes a comprehensive framework for simulating
        realistic drone behaviors and assessing the influence of design
        modifications and environmental factors on flight performance.

    <h1>Two-Dimensional Simulation</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>State Representation</h2>
      <p>
        A simulation is considered comprehensive if it can predict the drone's
        state \(X\) for subsequent discrete time intervals.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \( X = [x, y, \phi, \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}] \)
      </div>
      <p>
        Here, \(X\) encapsulates the drone's coordinates (\(x, y\)), rotational
        angle (\(\phi\)) about the x-axis, and their corresponding velocities
        (\(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}\)). The thrust forces (\(F_{1}\) and
        \(F_{2}\)) from the rotors, combined with environmental factors, result
        in the alteration of the state vector \(X\). The thrusts \(F_{1}\) and
        \(F_{2}\) are angled relative to the y-axis by \(\phi\).

      <h2>Dynamics Formulation</h2>
      <p>
        Dynamics are defined by how state \(X\) evolves under the influences of
        \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\). These forces are expressed through rotor
        velocities (\(\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}\)) and their quadratic relationship
        with thrust, denoted by \(k_{f}\), as shown in
        <a href="#johansen2004">1</a>.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">\( F_{i} = k_{f} \omega_{i}^2 \)</div>
      <p>
        The relationship \(k_{f}\) is determined empirically, as detailed in
        Chapter 4. Positional changes (\(x, y, \phi\)) result from integrating
        velocities (\(\dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{\phi}\)), which in turn are derived
        from integrating accelerations (\(\ddot{x}, \ddot{y}, \ddot{\phi}\)).
        These accelerations are obtained using \(F = ma\) and gravitational
        force \(F_{g} = mg\) with \(g = 9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}\):
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ -\ddot{y} = \frac{F_{g} - F_{y}}{m} = F_{y} - g \qquad \ddot{x} =
        \frac{F_{x}}{m} \]
      </div>
      <p>
        Here, \(F_{x}\) and \(F_{y}\) are the components of the total thrust
        force (\(F_{total}\)) along the x-axis and y-axis, respectively. They
        are determined using trigonometric relationships from the total thrust
        force (\(F_{total}\)) and angle \(\phi\):
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ F_{y} = F_{total} \cos{\phi} \qquad F_{x} = F_{total} \sin{\phi} \]
      </div>

      <p>
        In drone dynamics, we employ two torque formulas (\(M_{x}\)), each with
        distinct historical and physical foundations. The first, \(M_{x} =
        F_{\phi} L\), originates from Archimedes' concept of leverage (circa
        287–212 BC), where \(F_{\phi}\) represents the force from the drone's
        rotors and \(L\) is the lever arm - the distance from the center of mass
        to the motors. This equation captures the rotational effect of force.
        The second, \(M_{x} = I_{x} \ddot{\phi}\), is grounded in Newton's laws
        of motion (circa 1687), linking torque (\(M_{x}\)) with the drone's
        moment of inertia (\(I_{x}\)) and angular acceleration
        (\(\ddot{\phi}\)). Together, these formulas allow us to determine the
        angular acceleration of the drone.
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \[ M_{x} = F_{\phi}L \\ I_{x} \ddot{\phi} = (F_{2} - F_{1})L \\
        \ddot{\phi} = \frac{(F_{2} - F_{1}) L}{I_{x}} \]
      </div>

      <p>
        The state at time \(t\) is determined by the sum of the current state
        \(X(t)\) and the integral of the state's time derivative over the
        interval \(\Delta t\).
      </p>
      <div class="equation">
        \( X(t + \Delta t) = X(t) + \int_{t}^{t+\Delta t}\dot{X}(\tau) d\tau \)
